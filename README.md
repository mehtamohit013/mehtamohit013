### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Machine Learning Engineer and a recent graduate from New York University with interests in Machine learning, Data Science, and Data Engineering. My research interests lie in 3D computer vision, NeRFs, and Reinforcement learning.

- ðŸ”­ During my last full-time employment, I worked on 3D Generative AI at Spline(a Y Combinator-backed startup) as a Machine Learning Engineer. You can find the demo of my existing work [here](https://spline.design/ai-generate).
- ðŸ”­ During my summer internship, I was worked on [Ploomber](https://github.com/ploomber/ploomber)(a Y Combinator-based startup) with a focus on simplifying data science pipelines and enhancing SQL support in Jupyter Notebooks through [Jupysql](https://github.com/ploomber/jupysql)
- I am actively looking for FTE in the field of Machine Learning, Data Science, and Data Engineering.  If you have any openings, please feel free to contact me via email at [mehtamohit013@gmail.com](mailto:mehtamohit013@gmail.com).
